#### Windows

Windows is special, because the same repository is used for multiple
architectures.
Probably most people us 64 bit R on Windows, because that's
what RStudio starts by default.
But we also need to make sure that people who need 32 bit R will have a
way to install packages, without ruining the 64 bit installation.

Luckily, there are no packages on CRAN and Bioconductor currently that are
32 bit only.
(There are a few that are 64 bit only.)
In addition, 32 bit R currently installs the package both both
architectures, when installing for source.
(64 bit R-devel does the same currently, but this might change.)

In light of these, this is what we do:
- The default platform is `x86_64-w64-mingw32` on 64 bit R from R 4.2.
  It is `i386+x86_64-mingw32` on 64 bit R before R 4.2.
- The default platform is `i386+x86_64-w64-mingw32` on 32 bit R.
- The `windows` platform name is an alias to `i386+x86_64-w64-mingw32`.
- When compiling a package from source, we'll observe the requested
  platform name:
  - For `x86_64-w64-mingw32` on 64 bit R, we compile 64 bit only.
  - For `i386-w64-mingw32` on 64 bit R, we compile for both 32 bit and 64
    bit.
    (There is probably no way to avoid using the current arch.)
  - For `i386+x86_64-w64-mingw32` on 64 bit R, we compile for both 32 bit
    and 64.
  - For `i386-w64-mingw32` on 32 bit R, we compile for both 32 bit and 64
    bit.
    This is to avoid mistakenly messing up a 64 bit library.
  - For `x86_64-w64-mingw32` on 32 bit R, we compile for both 32 bit and 64
    bit.
    (There is probably no way to avoid using the current arch.)
  - For `i386+x86_64-w64-mingw32` on 32 bit R, we compile for both 32 bit
    and 64.

In summary, when compiling packages, we compile for both archs, unless the
platform is `x86_64-w64-mingw32` and we are in a 64 bit R session.
